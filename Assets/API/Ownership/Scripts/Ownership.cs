        /* Ownership is of extreme importance with networking. It is vital
         * to understand how ownership works.
         * 
         * Only clients may have ownership of an object, making them the owner. While the server ultimately
         * decides what happens with an object, the server itself never actually owns the object, only
         * clients may own objects. It's important to remember that when you perform base.IsOwner checks
         * you are performing them from the client, not the server.
         * 
         * Ownership allows a player to send ServerRpcs to the server, which is a common way
         * for a player to talk to the server. ServerRpcs are often used to request action by
         * the server. My Remote Calls video will cover ServerRpcs in more detail.
         * 
         * Generally ownership represents which player has the power to modify an object, such as
         * your character, or an item being held. But the uses are limitless.
         * 
         * The PlayerSpawner demo script illustrates how to spawn an object for a client, giving them
         * ownership, when they join the server.
         * 
         * There are also several other ways to receive ownership; below are some common options. */
